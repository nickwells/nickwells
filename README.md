### I'm currently working on ...

- the `gosh` Go code runner - it allows you to write and run small Go programs from the command line
- various command-line tools to help you write Go code.
- a collection of Go modules. These work together and provide a lot of the functionality of `gosh` and the other tools
- the param package - a powerful and flexible parameter parsing package for Go
